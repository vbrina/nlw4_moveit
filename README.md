&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is being made with React. So once you clone the repository, just make sure to install all its dependencies, that's why you need to run:

## 📓 Workshop #1
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this first workshop, was introduced the concept of React, such as Components, Props and States. With that, we've started creating the frontend project:</p>
<pre>yarn create react-app nlw4_moveit --template typescript</pre>
<p>Ps.: This project is using <strong>TypeScript</strong> because <strong>IS THE BEST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE EVER!</strong> 😂😂</p>
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first component that we've made is a Experience Bar. Its purpouse is to show the user his XP Level when he completes the workouts during the pauses.</p>
